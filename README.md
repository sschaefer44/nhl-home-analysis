# Analysis of Home Ice Advantage in the NHL (Last Updated 9/26/24)
1. The Jupyter Lab file contains an interactive graph at the bottom that allows the user to choose 1+ NHL teams for the X-Axis. The user also chooses the stat for the Y-Axis.
2. Data_Collection.py contains the web scraping script to obtain the raw data from the NHL website.
3. Regular_Season_Table.csv is the csv of the data scraped from the NHL website.
4. stats.py contains code from when I began the project. I was trying to do all the analysis only using standard python libraries before I decided to use pandas and numPY. There is a lot of code that was functional, so check it out if you're interested.
