# Analysis of Home Ice Advantage in the NHL
This program is created to use statistics to analyze the difference in team and league performance in the NHL when a team plays at home versus on the Road. This document serves as both an explanation of the methodology and programming, as well as the analysis of the computed data.

1. The Jupyter Lab file contains my analysis of the data as well as the code used to get the stats utilized in the analysis.
2. Data_Collection.py contains the web scraping script to obtain the raw data from the NHL website.
3. Regular_Season_Table.csv is the csv of the data scraped from the NHL website.
4. stats.py contains code from when I began the project. I was trying to do all the analysis only using standard python libraries before I decided to use pandas and numPY. There is a lot of code that was functional, so check it out if you're interested.
